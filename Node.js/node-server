Node Server:
1. Create file: server.js
In server.js:
2. let http = require('http');
  - this pulls in the HttpModule
3.create method:
http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200, { "Content-type": "text/plain" });// 200 = go ahead code; rest of it says that we want this to be plain text
    res.write("This is sent from a Node.js server"); //when we connect to our browser, it will print this string
    res.end(); //ends the method
  })
-req: shorthand for request
-res: shorthand for response


4. attach listen() method to the end of it:
http
  .createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200, { "Content-type": "text/plain" });
    res.write("This is sent from a Node.js server");
    res.end();
  })
  .listen(5000); //! when we run the server, we do not want to use the port 4200, because it'll be used by angular
5. When you initiate the server, it will suspend your console and run the server from the console.
- You can check this by checking the browser @ localhost:5000 (or whatever port number you listed)
6. To end the server, hit ctrl+c until it stops running


Routing:
-We want to take the same approach with components that we do with server routing.
-The main server file needs to be as clean as possible.
  -We do that with separating each route into its own folder
  -we need to import express into that folder
