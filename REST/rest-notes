There are a few basic rules we should follow whencreating our RESTful API.
1. Endpoints should use plural nouns to describe URI.
2. Do not include trailing forward slashes after theURI.
3. Hyphens should be used rather than camel-casingURI's. This is much easier to read and manage.
4. Underscores should never be used in URI's.
example:
Example from slides:
app.get("/students") // returns a list of all students
app.post("/students") // creates a new person
app.put("/students/:id") // updates a specific person based on id
app.delete("/students/:id") // deletes a specific person based on id

Working Example:
app.get("/people", (req, res) => { //get is typically used when we want to "get" data from something or somewhere
  res.send("fill this in later");
});
app.post("/people", (req, res) => { //post is typically used when we want to "post/input" information to the body
  res.send("added someone to the list");
});
app.put("/people/:id", (req, res) => {
  res.send("updated someone in the list");
});
app.delete("/people/:id", (req, res) => {
  res.send("deleted someone from the list");
});
