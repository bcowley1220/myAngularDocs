# myAngularDocs
This project is to help juniors and those coming into the language to have an easier understandable reference than the docs.
This repo exists because the docs for Angular isn't easily digestable for juniors or those new to the framework.
I am making this a txt file generated by an IDE over a straight doc file so you can take the code examples and
plug it straight into your own IDE.
