# My Notes Repo
This repo was originally for the notes from Grand Circus's Front End Bootcamp, but has morphed into a notes repo about everything in between. Feel free to gleen from it what you'd like. I occasionally add more to this repo as time progresses. 

# myAngularDocs (Previously Named)
This repo exists because the docs for Angular aren't easily digestable for juniors or those new to the framework.
I am making this a txt file generated by an IDE over a straight doc file so you can take the code examples and
plug it straight into your own IDE.

If you are interested in contributing please email b.cowley1220@gmail.com. This email is also the host for the GH master account.
Any external pull/merge requests will be reviewed by at least 1 admin before approval.

Thank you!
