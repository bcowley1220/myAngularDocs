- props.children
  -  When referencing a component, and you pass something in the middle of the open/close tags like so:
    <Person name="Seamus" age="4">
      My Favorite Hobby is: watching TV
    </Person>

    In the component that's being call, you must use props.children as a reference point if you want that information to show up:
    <p>{props.children}</p>
      - You can pass more information along than is needed, but you can't reference props.children without meeting the requirements

- state property is only available in a class based component that is extended from component
  - This allows us to access the props like so:
  state = {
    persons: [
      {name: 'Brendan', age: 33},
      {name: 'Amy', age: 35},
      {name: 'Seamus', age: 4},
    ]
  }

  <Person name={this.state.persons[0].name} age={this.state.persons[0].age} />
  <Person name={this.state.persons[1].name} age={this.state.persons[1].age} />
  <Person name={this.state.persons[2].name} age={this.state.persons[2].age}>

- If you want to use react hooks, you don't have to use class based components... you can just right them out functionally
