- props.children
  -  When referencing a component, and you pass something in the middle of the open/close tags like so:
    <Person name="Seamus" age="4">
      My Favorite Hobby is: watching TV
    </Person>

    In the component that's being call, you must use props.children as a reference point if you want that information to show up:
    <p>{props.children}</p>
      - You can pass more information along than is needed, but you can't reference props.children without meeting the requirements
