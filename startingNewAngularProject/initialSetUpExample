Example Startup Sequence Quick Reference:
1. Go to the location where you would like to place the new app file
2. ng new nameOfNewApp
3. ng g c nameOfComponent (repeat for each different component)
4. ng g i interfaces/nameOfInterface (repeat for each different interface)
5. ng serve --o 
  -ng serve --port portNumber (if serving more than 1)

Example Startup Sequence Full Reference:
1. Go to the location where you would like to place the new app file
  -You are placing a big ol' file in the next step, so make sure it's going in the right place
2. ng new nameOfNewApp
  -"ng" is shorthand for Angular
  -"new" tells the Angular cli (command line interface) to generate a new project
3. ng g c nameOfComponent (repeat for each different component)
  -"g" is shorthand for generate
  -"c" is shorthand for component
  -repeat this process for each new component that you need for your project
  -if you need to make parent/child components use:
  -ng g c parentComponent/childComponent
4. ng g i interfaces/nameOfInterface (repeat for each different interface)
  -"i" is shorthand for interface
  -the command above says: make a new folder named interfaces and put in a new interface.ts file of whatever name I give it.
  -You can store all of your interfaces in the same file since you will be calling them through import
5. ng serve --o 
  -This command tells the angular cli to send this entire file to your browser through port 4200. 
  -When you serve the project through your terminal/gitbash externally it will lock down that terminal. 
  To use more commands in terminal, open a new one through your IDE.
  -Once served, you can access this served file through http://localhost:4200/
  -If you are serving more than one project at a time, you will need to define a different port number to serve it through
  -ng serve --port 4201 (or any open port) will allow you to see the project in your browser
