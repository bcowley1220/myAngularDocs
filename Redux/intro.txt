Installing:
  - npm install redux react-redux
  - npm install redux-devtools --save-dev

Redux:
  - "Single Source Of Truth"
  Golden Rules of Redux
  1. You will have one single data store that will contain all state of app
  2. Anything that is defined in the data store is defined as read-only
  3. Changes are made with pure functions
    - Any time we change state, it has to be with a pure function, which returns us a new state

To Use Redux:
  - Need to create actions and reducers
  - Create in src:
    1. actions folder
    2. reducers folder
  - in Index.js:
    - import { Provider } from "react-redux";
      import { createStore } from "redux";
      import rootReducer from "./reducers/reducers";
    - under the import section: this allows App and it's children to use the store
      - let store =  createStore(rootReducer);
      - ReactDOM.render(
          <Provider store={store}>
            <App></App>
          </Provider>
        );

  - Building the reducers:
    - in reducers.js  
    - You need to define the data that is supposed to be stored


        This action will run every time we dispact an action
        - let rootReducer = (state = state, action) => {
        switch (action.type) {
          case "UPDATE_MY_INFO":
            console.log(action);
            return state;
          default:
            return state;
        }
      };

  - Building the actions:
    - in actions.js
      - export let updateMyInfo = payload => {
          return {
            type: "UPDATE_MY_INFO",
            payload
          };
        };

  - Importing into App.js
    - import { updateMyInfo } from "./actions/actions";
      import { useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";
    - the following needs to be set up above the return:
      -   let dispatch = useDispatch();
          dispatch(updateMyInfo("THIS IS DATA FROM APP")); //THIS WILL BE THE PAYLOAD
          let handleUpdate = event => {
            setMyInfo(event);
          };

  - Dispatch
    - https://redux.js.org/basics/store

  - useSelector
    - is a function that allows us to use a function the data store
