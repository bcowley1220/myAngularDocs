Default Join:
ex: 
  SELECT * FROM Student (get all the data from Student Table)
  JOIN Class ON Student.class_id = Class.id (join all of the class rows into student table, only if the student id is matching the class id)

Inner Join:
-Where both tables match:
  SELECT * FROM Student
  INNER JOIN Class ON Student.class_id = Class.id

Left Join:
-Takes the left table, and merges everything from the right into it, even if it doesn't match
  SELECT * FROM Student
  LEFT JOIN Class ON Student.class_id = Class.id


Right Join:
-Same process as left join, but takes the right table and merges everything from the left into it


Full Join:
-Takes both tables and brings them together, regardless if the table contents match together.
  SELECT * FROM Student
  FULL JOIN Class ON Student.class_id = Class.id
