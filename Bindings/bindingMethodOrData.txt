Are you trying to bind a method?

1. Yes:
  - Use parentheses (...)
  - (increase)="onIncreaseHandler()";
    - this is passing the onIncreaseHandler method from the parent component down to the child
  *Tip
      - to make sure that you bound the method properly, console.log() a string in the bound method to check if it works
2. No:
  - Use brackets [...]
  - [count]="count";
    - this is passing data (object) from the parent component to the down to the child
    *Tip
      - to make sure that you bound the data properly, add in a console.log() with the bound data to check if it works
